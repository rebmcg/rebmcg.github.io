<br> I was a postdoc in the joint lab of Dr. Daniel Starr and Dr. G.W. Gant Luxton at UC Davis. My goal was to understand how the assembly of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex affects the mechanical properties of cells, and how the assembly of the LINC complex is regulated. To study how the LINC comples regulates the mechanical properties of cells, I performed high-speed live imaging and microrheology experiments in hTERT-immortalized human airway smooth muscle cells. I also took a biochemical approach to studying LINC complex assembly and stability by utilizing mass photometry and differential scanning fluorimetry.

<br> For my graduate studies, I joined the lab of Dr. Wallace Marshall at UCSF to study the giant ciliate, <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>. During regeneration, <i>Stentor’s</i> nucleus changes shape in an extreme and developmentally regulated way, making it a powerful new model system to address this fundamental question in cell biology. I discovered the first molecular driver of this process, the nuclear transport factor, CSE1. I utilized immunofluorescence, live-cell imaging, and computational image analysis - often adapting these methods to work with a non-conventional model system.

						<b>Investigating LINC complex assembly and its effects on cellular mechanics</b>
						<br> During my postdoc at UC Davis, I studied the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. This is a molecular bridge composed of SUN and KASH proteins that span the two membranes of the nuclear envelope, mechanically integrating the nucleus with the cytoskeleton. How do the different LINC complex components affect the mechanical properties of the cell? This is especially important for the biology of smooth muscle, as LINC complexes help smooth muscle adapt to different mechanical environments. To address this question I performed passive microrheology experiments by live imaging human airway smooth muscle cells expressing genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs). I collaborated with a computational scientist in the lab to perform single-particle tracking of the GEMs and calculate their diffusion coefficients. By combining these microrheology experiments with knockdowns of LINC complex proteins, I quantified how the LINC complex affects macromolecular crowding in smooth muscle. 

									<br><br>In addition to my cell biology work, I also used a biochemical approach to investigate how the assembly of the LINC complex is regulated. I developed an <i>in vitro</i> assay using mass photometry to quantify SUN protein oligomerization and to determine how this is affected by buffer conditions and mutations. I also utilized differential scanning fluorimetry to measure how buffer conditions affect the stability of SUN proteins. These assays allowed me to investigate LINC assembly in finer detail than has been previously possible.

<b>Identified the first molecular driver of the macronuclear shape change cycle in <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>. </b>
<br>
During my graduate work in the Marshall Lab at UCSF, I studied <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>, a non-model organism that undergoes a dramatic and developmentally regulated nuclear shape change. During regeneration of <i>Stentor’s</i> oral apparatus, the macronucleus rapidly changes shape: it initially resembles a string of beads, then coalesces into a sphere, and then elongates back into its original moniliform shape. This process provides an excellent opportunity to study how cells regulate the size and shape of their nuclei. I found that the nuclear transport factor, CSE1, plays a role in altering the dynamics of this shape change: CSE1 is needed for the average volume per node to rapidly increase during condensation, and it is needed for the rapid change in the median number of nodes per macronucleus. CSE1 is also necessary for <i>Stentor</i> to maintain the moniliform shape of its macronucleus after regeneration is completed. Our model is that the transport of proteins into the nucleus alters the volume of the macronucleus, which in turn, alters the shape of the macronucleus due to constraints on the surface area of the macronuclear envelope.

						<b>Contributions towards establishing <i>Stentor</i> as a model system for studying cell biology of the nucleus</b>
						<br>In addition to my thesis work, I also worked as a part of multiple interdisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers to continue establishing <i>Stentor coeruleus</i> as a model system for cell biology. My work with <i>Stentor</i> contributed to two peer-reviewed publications, of which I am a middle author. While I was a Research Facilitator for the Physiology Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA, I proposed a project to measure the process of ciliary beat coordination as the oral apparatus of Stentor coeruleus develops during regeneration. As a part of my efforts to establish live imaging protocols for studying the macronucleus of <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>, I became an inventor on a patent with our collaborators from IBM Research.

								<b>Differential Scanning Fluorimetry Plotting</b>
<br>One of the main challenges of working with purified proteins is knowing which buffer will make the protein “happiest” – i.e. allow the protein to be as stable as possible when it is taken out of a cell and isolated in solution. For commonly studied proteins, oftentimes years of trial-and-error result in buffer recipes that are passed down from mentor to mentee. For a scientist working to purify a new protein, optimizing buffer conditions one by one is tedious and time consuming.
<br><br>There is a technique called differential scanning fluorimetry that allows the scientist to quantitatively measure their protein’s stability in 96 different buffers simultaneously; turning years of optimization into an experiment that takes an afternoon. Not only does this allow the scientist to choose the one buffer condition that promotes stability the most, but it can also be used to uncover interesting trends in protein stability as buffer conditions vary. Differential scanning fluorimetry works by using a qPCR machine and a dye called Sypro Orange to measure the melting temperature of a purified protein. As the protein unfolds at increasing temperatures, the dye binds to the exposed hydrophobic residues and its fluorescence increases - this fluorescence is measured by the qPCR machine. Comparing this melting temperature across many different buffer conditions allows us to determine which conditions promote protein stability.
<br><br>This python tool enables scientists to easily import their data and plot melt peaks to determine which condition promotes maximum stability. This tool also can plot protein stability data as a function of a particular buffer condition, like pH, to learn how different chemical conditions affect protein stability trends. To use the tool, download the jupyter notebook at the github link below. Follow the instructions in the notebook to input your buffer conditions and the melt data exported from CFX Maestro software. Then you can plot your melt peaks and create pandas queries to plot data by buffer, pH, salt, etc. For users who are new to using pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for making plots, the notebook provides detailed instructions for every step in the process. The example image above shows a plot containing all of the melt peaks from an entire 96-well plate buffer screen.

<p><b>Stentor Macronuclear Volume Analysis</b>
<br>It is very tricky to get 3D images of live <i>Stentor</i> - they are extremely thick samples for microscopy and they are very fast swimmers! One way to calculate the volume of <i>Stentor’s</i> macronucleus is to gently compress the cell in a rotocompressor, enough to slow the cell down but not enough to compress the macronucleus inside. This is a workflow that involves making a mask of the macronucleus, aligning the nodes along an axis of rotation, and then calculating the volume of the entire macronucleus. This was one of my first coding projects that involved jupyter notebooks and image analysis.
