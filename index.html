Throughout my scientific career, I have been interested in how cells use combinations of biological and physical mechanisms to regulate cellular functions. I have worked broadly across experimental systems, collaborated within interdisciplinary teams, and managed high-risk scientific projects. 
</p>

<p> <b>I am currently searching for my next role!</b> I am looking for industry scientist positions in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly roles in cell biology, biochemistry, and microscopy. I am also enthusiastic about opportunities to work with computational scientists and engineers. </p>

<br> I am currently a postdoc in the joint lab of Dr. Daniel Starr and Dr. G.W. Gant Luxton at UC Davis. My goal is to understand how the assembly of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex affects the mechanical properties of cells, and how the assembly of the LINC complex is regulated. To study how the LINC comples regulates the mechanical properties of cells, I am performing high-speed live imaging and microrheology experiments in hTERT-immortalized human airway smooth muscle cells. I am also taking a biochemical approach to studying LINC complex assembly and stability by utilizing mass photometry and differential scanning fluorimetry.

<b>Graduate Research </b>
<br> <span style="color: black;">University of California, San Francisco - </span><a href="https://cellgeometry.ucsf.edu/" style="color: black; text-decoration: none; outline: none;">Marshall Lab</a>
<br> For my graduate studies, I joined the lab of Dr. Wallace Marshall at UCSF to study the giant ciliate, <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>. During regeneration, <i>Stentor’s</i> nucleus changes shape in an extreme and developmentally regulated way, making it a powerful new model system to address this fundamental question in cell biology. I discovered the first molecular driver of this process, the nuclear transport factor, CSE1. I utilized immunofluorescence, live-cell imaging, and computational image analysis - often adapting these methods to work with a non-conventional model system.

						<b>Investigating LINC complex assembly and its effects on cellular mechanics</b>
						<br> I am studying the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. This is a molecular bridge composed of SUN and KASH proteins that span the two membranes of the nuclear envelope, mechanically integrating the nucleus with the cytoskeleton. How do the different LINC complex components affect the mechanical properties of the cell? This is especially important for the biology of smooth muscle, as LINC complexes help smooth muscle adapt to different mechanical environments. To address this question I am performing passive microrheology experiments by live imaging human airway smooth muscle cells expressing genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs). I am collaborating with a computational scientist in the lab to perform single-particle tracking of the GEMs and calculate their diffusion coefficients. By combining these microrheology experiments with knockdowns of LINC complex proteins, I am quantifying how the LINC complex affects macromolecular crowding in smooth muscle. 

									<br><br>In addition to my cell biology work, I am also using a biochemical approach to investigate how the assembly of the LINC complex is regulated. I am developing an <i>in vitro</i> assay using mass photometry to quantify SUN protein oligomerization and how this is affected by buffer conditions and mutations. I am also utilizing differential scanning fluorimetry to measure how buffer conditions affect the stability of SUN proteins. These assays will allow us to investigate LINC assembly in finer detail than has been previously possible.

<br><b>Identified the first molecular driver of the macronuclear shape change cycle in <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>. </b>
<br>
During my graduate work in the Marshall Lab at UCSF, I studied <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>, a non-model organism that undergoes a dramatic and developmentally regulated nuclear shape change. During regeneration of <i>Stentor’s</i> oral apparatus, the macronucleus rapidly changes shape: it initially resembles a string of beads, then coalesces into a sphere, and then elongates back into its original moniliform shape. This process provides an excellent opportunity to study how cells regulate the size and shape of their nuclei. I found that the nuclear transport factor, CSE1, plays a role in altering the dynamics of this shape change: CSE1 is needed for the average volume per node to rapidly increase during condensation, and it is needed for the rapid change in the median number of nodes per macronucleus. CSE1 is also necessary for <i>Stentor</i> to maintain the moniliform shape of its macronucleus after regeneration is completed. Our model is that the transport of proteins into the nucleus alters the volume of the macronucleus, which in turn, alters the shape of the macronucleus due to constraints on the surface area of the macronuclear envelope.

						<br><b>Contributions towards establishing <i>Stentor</i> as a model system for studying cell biology of the nucleus</b>
						<br>In addition to my thesis work, I also worked as a part of multiple interdisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers to continue establishing <i>Stentor coeruleus</i> as a model system for cell biology. My work with <i>Stentor</i> contributed to two peer-reviewed publications, of which I am a middle author. While I was a Research Facilitator for the Physiology Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA, I proposed a project to measure the process of ciliary beat coordination as the oral apparatus of Stentor coeruleus develops during regeneration. As a part of my efforts to establish live imaging protocols for studying the macronucleus of <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>, I became an inventor on a patent with our collaborators from IBM Research.

								<p>
								<b>Differential Scanning Fluorimetry Plotting</b>
<br>This is a technique that uses a qPCR machine and a dye called Sypro Orange to measure the melting temperature of a purified protein. As the protein unfolds at increasing temperatures, the dye binds to the exposed hydrophobic residues and its fluorescence increases - this fluorescence is measured by the qPCR machine. Comparing this melting temperature across many different buffer conditions allows us to determine which conditions promote protein stability. This jupyter notebook allows you to input your buffer conditions and the melt data exported from CFX Maestro software. Then you can plot your melt peaks and create queries to plot data by buffer, pH, salt, etc. This image shows all of the plots from an entire 96-well plate buffer screen.

<p><b>Stentor Macronuclear Volume Analysis</b>
<br>It is very tricky to get 3D images of live <i>Stentor</i> - they are extremely thick samples for microscopy and they are very fast swimmers! One way to calculate the volume of <i>Stentor’s</i> macronucleus is to gently compress the cell in a rotocompressor, enough to slow the cell down but not enough to compress the macronucleus inside. This is a workflow that involves making a mask of the macronucleus, aligning the nodes along an axis of rotation, and then calculating the volume of the entire macronucleus. This was one of my first coding projects that involved jupyter notebooks and image analysis.

I had just spent the past few months thinking non stop about <i>Stentor's</i> macronucleus, and how it is positioned within the cell relative to pattern of blue-green stentorin pigment and clear microtubule bundles on the outside of the cell. Over the following years my research ended up focusing more on the change in shape of the macronucleus instead of how it is positioned. So, the question that inspired this piece has yet to be answered!
